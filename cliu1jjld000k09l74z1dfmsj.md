## intro

Greetings everyone! Allow me to tell you how my own journey into the world of software development began. I have loved the world of computers since I was a child and was lucky enough to have the opportunity to buy my own computer. This adventure dates back to the mid-90s. Even though there was only dial-up internet back then, I was immersed in the magical world of DOS and Windows 3.1. Games such as Doom, Prince of Persia, Prehistoric and Flashback were still available on floppy disks.

### Back in the days

I imagine many of us have similar memories. Then the websites arrived. In the early 2000s, I had already created my first own website using Geocities, developed by Yahoo. I wanted to use this site to showcase my music to the world.

### WordPress

As the years went by, life took me in a different direction. In college, I took a small course in web page editing, Java, and the like, but didn't really have a breakthrough. Then in 2016, I took a WordPress course and even got a certificate for it. Since then, learning WordPress and my love for it has filled my everyday life. It's actually my job, as I create websites and webshops for individuals and businesses as part of my business. I have worked as a marketer for almost 7 years, so naturally, I am also involved in SEO, which I also offer as a service.

Therefore, I am constantly learning, as WordPress and the possibilities it offers, as well as the learning resources SEO provides, are endless. However, after a while, I felt that I needed to understand more deeply what was under the hood of software development. I wanted to know how and why it worked. So I started watching online courses on YouTube and bought additional courses on Udemy.

### Deep Dive

However, I usually just started things and did a few projects. So I thought that I should keep my learning organized if I really wanted to do this. That is why I decided to enroll in an adult education course in software development. In fact, I enrolled twice, the first time in 2018, but then I couldn't finish it because of work and other commitments. Where would I be now... However, last year I enrolled again for the same course. Since then, the course has changed, but I'll tell you about that later. The training is very intensive and time-consuming, but I am struggling to overcome the obstacles because I am very interested in this field and I don't want to give up a second time.

Thanks to my perseverance, I have successfully completed the first year, so I am looking forward to the second. But I don't want to be lazy in the summer either. I've taken the courses I bought earlier, and I've also bought some new ones to cover the topics I'll need for the final exam. I don't want to spend the summer without studying, because then in September I'd certainly feel like I'd forgotten everything. So I'll work a bit in advance and make it easier for myself because I'll be studying a lot of topics that we'll only cover later, but I'll already know them.

So, if you find this journey exciting, stay tuned and subscribe to my blog. I promise I'll talk in more detail about technical stuff later, but for now, it's just an introduction to give you an idea of where my struggle started.

Best regards, Peter
