Well, the main reason why I started to learn how to develop a WordPress plugin is a bit long story, and I am sure that many of you out there has similar experiences. Let me tell you mine.

## 1st reason:

So the first reason is that I have spent so much money on different plugins, for different problems to solve. 

## 2nd reason

The second reason is that I don't want to use a plugin for everything. So while you learn how to build a plugin, you will see that there are so much more and simpler options than just installing and using a plugin. For example, I am sure that instead of using 3 plugins for different purposes, you can surely add the scripts that those plugins are using into a code snippet, or add it to the functions.php. But that was just an example. The solution can be different in many ways. 

## 3rd reason

The third reason is that I want to understand, how these things are working. I create websites and webshops for a living, so I want to deliver the highest quality that is possible. So damn sure I have to dive in if I want to be good in it. 

## 4th reason

Fourth reason: I am studying every day to become a full-stack developer. It is a good practice as well. You can practice PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Js, version control, and many other things, by just finding a solution to your problems.

## 5th reason

The fifth reason is to find a solution to your problems. Previously, I started to study plugins a theme development without a plan. I've just wanted to learn it, to be more professional. But It is much easier if you study it with an exact purpose. 

For example, I have many unfinished projects, because I lost my interest in them on the way. But after a period, I ran into some problems that pushed me to dive in again and again. And as soon as I had some "personal" problems to solve - for example, environment dependency problems while developing a theme - I had the motivation to keep going. 

Same with plugin development. I have bought several courses, to have a guided study curve. But it is just getting boring sometimes. Until you run into a "personal" problem in your everyday work. In my case something got my website slowing down, so I started to investigate in that way, till I found out there is no solution for my problems in that way that I want it to. So, let's develop a solution for it, that is personalized for my needs.

## 6th reason

The sixth reason. If you get good enough, and your stuff is working well, you can earn some money as well. Even if it is just a couple of dollars, it still feels good, to get paid for something that you have done for fun.  

So I guess if you are at the beginning of this road, you can pick one reason for this 6 above, and use it as a star in the night sky, so if you are lost, and out of motivation, maybe it helps to get you back on track!

Good luck!
