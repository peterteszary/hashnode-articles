The software package to be developed for the final exam is a set of several components that support each other. The 3 components: WordPress theme, WordPress plugin, Java desktop application.  

Why these and why so?

Because the output requirements for the exam are: Desktop application in Java or C#. Web application to be used in: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, REST API and some database. So my idea was to mix the pleasant with the useful. Some of my clients have indicated that they find it difficult to use WordPress because there are too many options in the admin interface, too many menu items. That's why I came up with the idea of replacing the more complicated WordPress interface with a desktop application with a simple interface. All they have to do is log in to the desktop application and create a new product and publish it.  

Sounds simple, right?

Well it's a bit more complicated than it looks, but my next 5 months will be about solving this with my team. So the plan is to develop a theme that covers HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, REST API, Database and Java. But what is also very important is that we need to cover all aspects that are needed for a software development.

Designs, UI/UX, Database design, documentation, testing, logs etc. All of this with GitHub commits, Project management and everything else, really like a real live project, We have to do it that way. So tomorrow I'll create the environments. The documentation and repositories are already done.

The Design is done. Development is underway (by the way, the whole project will have its own page, which we want to host using GitHub Pages. I thought it would be better to have a live documentation than a "paper" one.
